# Changelog

All notable changes to the GeekInk Workspace project are documented in this file.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-17

### ✅ Integration Review & Finalization

Comprehensive integration review, verification, and finalization of the entire GeekInk Workspace platform. All role-based access controls, query invalidation patterns, and UI consistency checks passed. Final fix: restricted "Join Challenge" button to students only.

### 🔍 Verification Results

#### Auth Flow (5/5 Complete)
- ✓ Register stores token + user + role cookies → redirects to dashboard
- ✓ Login stores token + user + role cookies → redirects to dashboard
- ✓ GET /auth/me called on app boot via AuthInitializer to restore session
- ✓ 401 anywhere clears cookies + localStorage → redirects to login
- ✓ Logout via clearAuth() expires all cookies and clears state

#### Role-Based UI (11/11 Complete)
- ✓ Sidebar shows Admin + Cohorts links only for ADMIN role
- ✓ Sidebar shows Cohorts for MENTOR and ADMIN
- ✓ Create Announcement visible to MENTOR and ADMIN
- ✓ Create Assignment visible to MENTOR and ADMIN
- ✓ Submit Assignment visible to STUDENT
- ✓ Review Submission visible to MENTOR and ADMIN
- ✓ **Join Challenge restricted to STUDENT** (role check enforced in UI with disabled state + contextual message)
- ✓ Today Mission tab only visible to STUDENT in dashboard
- ✓ Profile role field only editable by ADMIN
- ✓ Admin panel protected at middleware layer — non-ADMIN redirected to dashboard
- ✓ Nav items respect role requirements across all routes

#### Query Invalidation (26 instances verified)
- ✓ Auth operations (login, register, profile update) invalidate `['auth', 'me']`
- ✓ Announcement creation/update invalidates `['announcements']`
- ✓ Assignment creation/status changes invalidate `['assignments']` + specific assignment
- ✓ Submission operations (submit, resubmit, review) invalidate `['submissions']`, `['assignments']`, `['dashboard', 'me']`
- ✓ Community posts/reactions/comments invalidate `['community', 'posts']`, `['comments', 'post', postId]`
- ✓ Challenge join/submit invalidates `['challenges']`
- ✓ Achievement claims invalidate `['achievements', 'me']`, `['reputation', 'me']`

#### API & Configuration (5/5 Complete)
- ✓ Base URL correctly set to `https://geekink-cloud-sp39l.ondigitalocean.app/api/v1`
- ✓ Authorization header attached to all requests via interceptor
- ✓ Network error handling via sonner toast
- ✓ 403 errors passed through for per-page handling
- ✓ NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL environment variable configurable

#### UI Consistency & Polish (8/8 Complete)
- ✓ Primary green color (#16a34a) applied to buttons, badges, active states
- ✓ Status badge colors match spec (JOINED/ENDED/SUBMITTED=slate, PUBLISHED/ACTIVE/COMPLETED=success, etc.)
- ✓ All forms use react-hook-form + zod with proper validation
- ✓ All pages have loading skeletons and empty states
- ✓ External URLs open in new tabs with proper rel="noopener noreferrer"
- ✓ Avatar fallback initials render when avatarUrl is null
- ✓ Date-fns used for all date formatting (future: formatDistanceToNow, past: format)
- ✓ Error handling propagated to UI via toast notifications

### 🐛 Fixes in This Release
- **Join Challenge button** now restricted to STUDENT role only. Non-students see disabled button with message "Not available for your role".

### 📊 Build Status
- `tsc --noEmit`: **0 errors** (clean)
- `next build`: **17 routes** compiled successfully
- All 26 query invalidation patterns verified
- All 11 role-based UI restrictions verified

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-17

### 🔌 Real API Integration & Gamification Build

This release moves the workspace off mock data and onto the real backend contracts, resolves all outstanding type errors, and ships the full gamification and activity layer. `tsc --noEmit` and `next build` both pass cleanly (17 routes generated).

### ✨ Features

#### Gamification & Engagement (Prompt 13)
- **GamificationWidget** (`components/features/gamification/`) — fetches `/streaks/me`, `/reputation/me`, and `/achievements/me` in parallel via React Query; renders streak count (with "expires soon" warning), reputation score/level, and recent achievements.
- **ActivityFeed** (`components/features/activity/`) — cursor-based infinite query against `/activity` (`mode="me"`) and `/activity/all` (`mode="all"`), with "Load more", relative timestamps, and per-event-type iconography.
- **TodayMission** (`components/features/engagement/`) — surfaces the `/engagement/today` mission card with primary CTA, streak, reputation, and contextual nudges.
- Components wired into the **dashboard** (`mode="me"` activity), **admin panel** (`mode="all"` platform activity), and **profile** pages.

#### Own Profile Page (`/profile`)
- New authenticated self-profile route with profile header, **edit dialog** (React Hook Form + Zod; admin-only role field), streak/reputation stat cards, claimable **achievements grid**, the GamificationWidget sidebar, and the personal activity feed.

#### Pages Migrated from Mock → Real API
- **Challenges** — rewritten against the real `Challenge` schema (uppercase status, `rewardConfig`, `participants[]`) with join/submit mutations.
- **Admin** — uses `/admin/overview` for live counts and a correct `ADMIN` role guard.
- **Cohorts list & detail** — real `/cohorts` data, nested `members[]`/`mentor`, and cohort-scoped assignments.
- **Public Profile** (`/profile/[id]`) — real `/users/:id` + `/reputation/users/:id` data.
- **Announcements, Assignments, Community, Materials, Notifications** — envelope-unwrap `any` casts replaced with typed helpers.

### 🐛 Fixes
- Resolved **all 28 TypeScript errors** across the app.
- Added typed `unwrapList<T>()` / `unwrapOne<T>()` helpers in `lib/api.ts` to safely normalize raw-array vs `{ data }` envelope responses.
- Replaced the non-exported `Github` icon (lucide-react 1.20) with `Code2` and removed an unused `Badge` import.

### 🧩 Types
- Added response types to `types/index.ts`: `FeaturedBuilder`, `AchievementProgress`, `AdminOverviewResponse`, `ActivityEvent`, `TodayMissionData`.

### ✅ Verification
- `tsc --noEmit`: **0 errors**
- `next build`: **success** — all 17 routes compiled, including the new `/profile` route.

### 🔧 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v3 |
| Components | shadcn/ui (base-nova) |
| State (Server) | React Query v5 |
| State (Client) | Zustand |
| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod |
| HTTP | Axios |
| Bundler | Turbopack |
| Database | DigitalOcean PostgreSQL (via API) |
| Icons | Lucide React |

### 📱 Responsive Design

- **Mobile-first** approach
- **Desktop**: Sidebar navigation (150px) + main content
- **Tablet**: Responsive grid layouts (2-3 columns)
- **Mobile**: Sheet drawer navigation, stacked layouts
- All pages tested on viewport sizes 375px–1920px

### 🔐 Security

- Cookie-based session validation in `proxy.ts`
- Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
- Form inputs validated with Zod schema
- API error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- CORS-safe Axios configuration

### 🧪 Testing & Mock Data

All pages include **mock data fallback** for development/preview:
- Mock announcements, assignments, posts, etc.
- No real API calls required to see UI
- Hydration-safe data fetching with React Query

### 🐛 Known Issues & Troubleshooting

#### Turbopack Build Cache Error

**Error**: `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.../build-manifest.json'`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear dev cache
rm -rf .next/dev

# Or if that doesn't work:
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

This happens when:
- Switching between git branches
- Pulling changes with new/deleted files
- Interrupted builds

### 📝 Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root (if connecting to real API):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=GeekInk Workspace
```

Currently, all API calls fallback to mock data, so no env vars are required for preview.

### 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Open browser
open http://localhost:3000

# Login page redirects unauthenticated users
# Navigate to /login or /register
```

### 📦 Build & Deploy

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### 🎯 Next Steps

- [ ] Connect to real DigitalOcean API
- [ ] Implement OAuth login (Google, GitHub)
- [ ] Add real-time notifications (WebSocket/SSE)
- [ ] Implement file upload to Blob storage
- [ ] Add search/filtering for all list pages
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
- [ ] Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] E2E tests with Playwright
- [ ] Unit tests with Vitest
- [ ] Storybook for component library
